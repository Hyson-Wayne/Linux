# **<span style="color:green">Project 1: Automated User and Group Management System</span>**

## **Objective**
Automate the creation, modification, and verification of user accounts and groups using shell scripting.

---

## **Tasks**

1. Write a shell script to:
   - Create a list of users provided in a file (e.g., `users.txt`).
   - Assign each user to specific groups defined in another file (e.g., `groups.txt`).
   - Set unique passwords for each user and ensure password security.
   - Grant administrative (sudo) privileges to selected users.
2. Validate your script:
   - Verify the successful creation of users and groups by listing them.
   - Display all groups each user belongs to.
3. Log all actions performed by the script into an audit log file (`audit.log`).

---

## **Deliverables**

- The shell script: `user_group_manager.sh`.
- Input files: `users.txt` and `groups.txt`.
- Log file: `audit.log` showing all actions performed.
