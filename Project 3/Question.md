# Project 3: System Monitoring with Cron Jobs  

## Objective  
Automate system monitoring using a shell script scheduled with cron jobs.  

## Tasks  
1. Create a shell script (`system_monitor.sh`) that:  
   - Displays system uptime.  
   - Checks and logs disk space usage.  
   - Shows memory usage.  
   - Logs the above details into a file (`monitor.log`).  
2. Schedule the script to run every hour using a cron job.  
3. Validate the cron job:  
   - Check the `monitor.log` file after several hours to verify periodic execution.  

## Deliverables  
- The shell script (`system_monitor.sh`).  
- The cron job configuration.  
- A sample `monitor.log` showing the logged system details.
